## Introduction
This project demonstrates JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) implementation, showcasing how to connect Java applications with relational databases. It provides examples of various database operations using JDBC.

## Features
- Database connection establishment
- CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- Prepared statements for secure queries
- Transaction management
- Result set handling
- Connection pooling (optional)

## Technologies Used
- **Java:** Programming language
- **JDBC:** Java Database Connectivity API
- **MySQL/MariaDB:** Relational database
- **Maven:** Dependency management and build tool

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Java Development Kit (JDK) 1.8 or higher
- MySQL/MariaDB database
- Maven (for build and dependency management)

### Installation
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Chandrashekharwagh/jdbc-connectivity-project.git
   cd jdbc-connectivity-project
   ```

2. **Setup the database:**
   Create a database and necessary tables in your MySQL/MariaDB instance.

3. **Configure database connection:**
   Update the `db.properties` file with your database connection details.

4. **Build the project:**
   ```bash
   mvn clean install
   ```

## Usage
1. **Database Connection:**
   ```java
   Connection conn = DriverManager.getConnection(url, username, password);
   ```

2. **Execute Queries:**
   ```java
   Statement stmt = conn.createStatement();
   ResultSet rs = stmt.executeQuery("SELECT * FROM users");
   ```

3. **Prepared Statements:**
   ```java
   PreparedStatement pstmt = conn.prepareStatement("INSERT INTO users (name, email) VALUES (?, ?)");
   pstmt.setString(1, "John Doe");
   pstmt.setString(2, "john@example.com");
   pstmt.executeUpdate();
   ```

4. **Transaction Management:**
   ```java
   conn.setAutoCommit(false);
   try {
       // Perform multiple operations
       conn.commit();
   } catch (SQLException e) {
       conn.rollback();
   }
   ```
